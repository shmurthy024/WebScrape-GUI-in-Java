# WebScrape-GUI-in-Java
A Web Scrape GUI that allows you to access information about the Coronavirus as well as updates in the major stock indices. I picked these two areas to web scrape because these are subjects that are discussed daily and it would be cool to show both in one easy Java GUI.
The GUI should be extremely easy to understand and use. The whole goal of my project was to understand how to pull information from websites and display that in a clean manner for all to see. The project took me a few days but I learned a lot about this subject and more about Java's vast resources to make sure I could excel in creating this project.
